\subsection{Airtime}
\label{sec:LoRaTiming}
A \ac{lora} transmission consists of a number of symbols, 
Configuration of these parameters effect transmission time
The time a \ac{lora} symbol takes to transmit can be calculated



% Time model realtime using predicted lora airtimes
% Model discrete events

\label{sec:RadioCollisions}

% Seperate model for collisions from 91197515.pdf
% receivers are able to detect when a collision has occurred increasing liklihood of getting second packet, this has not been implemented as its performance has not been verifiable
\subsection{Receive Chance}
% Sigmoid packet chance functions?
