\subsection{Open (Free) Space}
High noise floor indicates that either the receiver's noise figure is not correct or there is more noise than expected in the environment. The fact that demodulation limit is nowhere near the true limit for SF10 onwards suggests that the cheaper radio does not perform correctly.
