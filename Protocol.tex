\chapter{Proposed Protocol}
\section{Considerations}
% Coping with hops, on demand (reactive) or table driven (proactive), (minimise need but use AODV or DSR). 
LoRa packets can only be 256 bytes (due to FIFO buffer size, see official documentation https://www.semtech.com/products/wireless-rf/lora-transceivers/SX1276).
LoRa packet transmit time ranges from 200ms to 1s depending on packet size.\

\section{Proposal}
% Duty cycles (decided on method [manage per hour])
% Bands (dual band)
% Message types
% PHY layer parameter selection
% Adaptiveness???
% a461331.pdf general collision avoidance
%

Phy testing has shown that distance cannot be covered by a gateway
Proposed solution is agnostic to routing protocol
