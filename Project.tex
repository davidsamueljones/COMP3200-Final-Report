\begin{abstract}
Swarms are mobile multi-robot systems that communicate in a decentralised manner to achieve their goals. For complex robots these interactions are typically handled using high-data-rate technologies such as Wi-Fi or LTE, however, when operating in areas with no cellular infrastructure at ranges beyond the capabilities of Wi-Fi, neither option is feasible.  This paper identifies the long-range, low-data-rate technology of \ac{lora} to serve this scenario. \ac{lora} is typically deployed in low-power sensor networks; leading to radio testing literature using highly elevated antenna. Swarm deployments must rely on ground level transmissions. Therefore this project initially covers real-world radio testing in free-space and forests to assess how deployment scenarios affect \ac{lora}'s physical radio performance. Overall range results indicate that \ac{lora} ground level transmissions

% From this, demodulation models are extracted and combined with \ac{lora} collision models from literature to create a simulator for testing \ac{lora} ad-hoc scenarios. This simulator is then used to analyse the effectiveness of three \ac{mac} protocols with the aim of prioritising data distribution to physically local neighbours. Two methods utilise common approaches (ALOHA and \ac{csma}), and the third attempts to exploit hardware parameters and regional \ac{rf} regulations; this is defined as the LoRa Local Broadcast Protocol (\ac{llbp}).

%  Interconnected devices and mobile multi- robot systems are increasingly present in many real- life scenarios. To be effective, these systems need to collect large amounts of data from their environment, and often these data need to be aggregated, shared, and distributed. Many multi-robot systems are de- signed to share state information and commands, but their communication infrastructure is often too lim- ited for significant data transfers. This paper introduces SOUL (Swarm-Oriented Upload of Labeled data), a mechanism that allows members of a fully distributed system to share data with their peers. We leverage a BitTorrent-like strategy to share data in smaller chunks, or datagrams, with policies that minimize re- construction time. We performed extensive simulations to study the properties of the system and to demon- strate its scalability. We report experiments conducted with real robots following two realistic deployment sce- narios: searching for objects in a scene, and replacing the full identity of a defective robot.
 
 
% This report presents the results of an investigation of the viability of capacitive coupling as a feasible communication scheme implementable in swarms and self- assembly systems. 

%Swarm robotics and self-assembly systems rely on the ability of individual members to communicate to be able to achieve swarm goals and tasks. Swarms and self-assembly systems present implementation and research challenges due to their high budget requirements and are implemented using microcontrollers for their processing needs. The achievement of a low-cost and easy to imple- ment communication scheme between microcontrollers would lead to lower budget swarm robotics and self-assembly systems. A basic data transmission scheme is experimented upon using a capacitive channel. Bit patterns are passed from one microcontroller to another over a capacitive channel for a fixed time duration and under diâ†µerent channel conditions. The receiving microcontroller is able to detect the modulated signal and accuracy is seen to vary with channel parameters like area, dielectric and data rate. The receiving microcontroller relies only on avail- able hardware within the microcontroller for signal detection. The results prove a capacitive coupling scheme could enable data transmission between two or even more microcontrollers and presents areas for further investigation such as the de- sign of a robust and reliable communication scheme that builds upon the stated results.
